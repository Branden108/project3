        <p>This is where I went to Elementary School. I was one of the first students who went here as it was just built when I entered the 1st grade.
		  Located in Gilberts, Illinois, a suburb apart of northern Kane County. This school is part of the 6th largest school district in Illinois, District 300.</p>
