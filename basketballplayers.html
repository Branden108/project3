      <h1>My Top 5 Basketball Players</h1>
	<section id="kobe">
	  <h2>#5 Kobe Bryant</h2>
	    <img src="images/kobe.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant biting jersey wearing 24" width="400" height="500"> 
	      <ul>
	        <li>1996-2016 Los Angeles Lakers</li>
	        <li>25.0 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1.4 SPG</li>

	      </ul>
	      <p>Byrant's lasting impact to the game was his cerebral edge and unquenchable desire to master it, despite all of his statistacal accomplishments, including the five championships, the 81-point game, and the 60 point performance in his final game, and the 20 seasons spent with the game team. After Bryant passed away, "Mamba Mentality" evolved from a corny catchphrase to a guide for achieving your goals.</p>

	  <h2>#4 Bill Russell</h2>
	    <img src="images/bill.jpg" alt="Bill Russell with his hands on his cheeks while wearing all 11 NBA Championship rings" width="400" height="500">

	<section id="kareem">
	  <h2>#3 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
	    <img src="images/kareem.jpg" alt="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar doing a skyhook over Pistons player" width="400" height="500">
